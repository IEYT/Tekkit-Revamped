# Tekkit : Revamped 
This Modpack tries to make a Tekkit-Like modpack for 1.16.5. It has some ports like **ProjectE**(_EE2_), **ProjectRed**(_RedPower_), **Buildcraft**(Same Name, _Buildcraft_), And **FTB Industrial Contraptions**(Based off of _IC2_), While having modern mods like **Thermal Series**(Multiple Mods), **Mekanism**(All 3 mods), **Create** and more ports and new mods! 
- This modpack has around 190-200 mods, Which is a pretty large amount, so to have good fps, you have to have a decent pc and/or turn the settings down.
- ## Issues and Concerns
- **Caution**: This Modpack Contains Mods that may crash your world. To avoid losing progress, make backups frequently. This is more amplified by this mod packs current _alpha quality_.
- _Alpha quality_: This modpack has little to no testing, many of the materials and items dont have emc values, There are recipe and texture errors(~5-10 texture errors noticable in game), and probably more.
